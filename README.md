This code currently estimates the ground state energy (zero temperature) for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the grand canoncial ensemble given system parameters (L, N_target, U, t, mu). The ground state energy is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations for integration and Gradient Descent for parameter optimization. 

Please see the "run_benchmark.jl" file for more information on how to run the code.
